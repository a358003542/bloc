# bloc
 A fork of my blocklib code from Architecture of Open Source Applications: 500 Lines or Less http://www.aosabook.org/en/500L/blockcode-a-visual-programming-toolkit.html

The goal of this is to show how to build a very simple block-based visual programming language suitable for re-use. Unlike the code in the AOSA book, this version should work on mobile as well.
